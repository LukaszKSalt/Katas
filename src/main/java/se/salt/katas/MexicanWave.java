/**
 * Task
 * In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave.
 * You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.
 * <p>
 * Rules
 *  1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
 * <p>
 *  2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
 * <p>
 * Example
 * wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]
 * <p>
